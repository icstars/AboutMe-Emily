    <h2>Greetings!</h2>
    <div>
        <p>I'm a Wisconsin native with product management experience working to become a web developer. I take pride in my knack for staying organized as well as my communication skills.
            Beyond the digital realm, I'm an outdoor and wellness enthusiast who revels in exploring Wisconsin's natural beauty, from hiking through our picturesque forests to embracing a healthy lifestyle as a personal trainer. 
            I'm eager to expand my knowledge and on the lookout for exciting work opportunities. If you're in need of a web developer, I'd love to connect!</p>
